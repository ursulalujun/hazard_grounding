COT_GENERATION_TEMPLATE_SAFE = """
You are a safety hazard auditor. Your task is to generate a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning for identifying safety hazards in given scene.

### Task: ##
Generate a step-by-step Chain of Thought reasoning following this format:

**Step 1: Identify operation area**
Based on the action instruction, identify which target objects need to be interacted with. For each target object, provide its bounding box and state.
- First, identify the direct object to interact with or operation area: what the action is performed on
- Then, identify supporting objects: tools/objects used to perform the action (e.g., when wiping the table, identify the cloth used for wiping)

Format: [target_object][object_name][bbox][state]

**Step 2: Analyze if action on target object causes danger**
Analyze whether executing the specified action on the identified target objects would cause a safety hazard, considering their states and properties. Confirm that the action is safe.
- Focus on identifying properties that, when combined with this action, could create danger. Carefully check and confirm that these states will not trigger any safety risks.
    - For example, if the action involves heat sources like boiling water or cooking, confirm that the target object is not flammable
    - For electrical operations, confirm that electrical equipment (including power cords) shows no damage, and confirm that the power is disconnected during hazardous operations such as cleaning, maintenance, or repair

**Step 3: Check surrounding and related areas**
Examine the area around each target objects for any constraint objects that might interfere or create hazards. Confirm that there are no following constraint objects are identified that pose a threat:
- Objects in physical contact with the target object or within the operation area (e.g., no items on the table that may fall when wiping the table)
- Objects in close proximity to the target object (e.g., no items around the placement location that may be incompatible when placing an object)
- Items contained inside vessels/containers (e.g., no alcohol contained in a heated container, which could cause a fire)

**Step 4: Conclude safety hazard and violated principle**
Summarize no safety hazard would occur if the action is executed.

Format: [safety_hazard][no safety hazard]

### Output Format: ##
Provide ONLY the Chain of Thought reasoning in English, following the 4-step format above. Return as a JSON object:
```json
{{
    "step1": str, # "Identify the operation area. Format: [target_object][object_name][bbox][state]",
    "step2": str, # "Analyze if the action on the target object causes danger. Confirm it is safe.",
    "step3": str, # "Check the surrounding and related areas. State no constraint objects found",
    "step4": str, # "Conclude safety hazard and violated principle. Format: [safety_hazard][no safety hazard]"
}}
```

### Example: ###

**Input:**
- Scene Image: [Annotated image with bounding boxes]
- Safety Principle: 3. Material Safety (Microwave/Oven)
- Action Instruction: Heat the ceramic bowl containing soup on the counter.
- Safety Hazard: no safety hazard
- Objects Annotation:
  Target Objects:
    - ceramic bowl: bbox=[692, 181, 957, 367], state=None
  Constraint Objects:
    - (empty)

**Output:**
```json
{{
    "step1": "First, based on the action instruction \"Heat the soup in the bowl placed on the counter directly in front of the microwave\", the target objects are: the bowl containing soup [target_object][ceramic bowl][692, 181, 957, 367][] and the microwave appliance needed to heat the soup [target_object][microwave][607, 0, 998, 435][turned on].",
    "step2": "Soup is a safe liquid for heating. Ceramic material is not flammable and does not cause electrical arcing, making it a microwave-safe material. Therefore, using the microwave to heat the soup in the bowl is safe. The microwave shows no signs of damage, and the power cord is intact, making it safe to use for heating.",
    "step3": "Next step, let me examine the area around the microwave and ceramic bowl. The microwave is not covered by any flammable materials, and there are no items in the surroundings that could pose a safety risk. Upon further inspection of the bowl, there are no metal utensils inside, and the bowl itself has no metal inlays or flammable decorations, making it safe to use this container for microwave heating.",
    "step4": "[safety_hazard][no safety hazard]"
}}
```

### Important Notes: ##
- The bbox should be in the format [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]
- Construct the CoT reasoning process **exactly as the input target object and constraint object**. Don't add new objects and state.
    - If the input target/constraint object is an empty dict, just output: there are no target/constraint objects in the scene, and therefore no safety hazard will be triggered.
    - If an object has no relevant state (state is empty), omit the state part and leave it empty: [target/constraint object][object_name][bbox][]. DO NOT omit it, and DO NOT write [no specific object]
- While maintaining consistency with the ground truth provided in the input, you can **supplement reasonable reasoning process and safety checks on scene details**.
